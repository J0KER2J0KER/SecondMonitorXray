This Mod allows you to Xray on your second Monitor.

After the game boots up, a second window opens, which can be placed whereever you want. When joining a world the default Minecraft rendering pipeline is not changed at all, the mod just grabs the coordinates of all ores and renders them in the second window as well.

With that you are able to share your screen and xray at the same time without anyone noticing.
